## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/tMaSFigP/labs-13-stock-price)

[Product Canvas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sErdl9BUTUBLWGJuNJwEJ_Yq9q2HgXrK-gNHbhKKqvA/edit#heading=h.1jaf6eug9n0k)

Stak is a trading platform that integrates sentiment from social media data sources. 

We combine traditional technical trading signals with sentiment analysis, alllowing the user to make more profitable trades.

[Deployed Front End](https://stock-price-stripe.herokuapp.com/)

### Tech Stack

Python

- Dash and Flask for API and Web Applications
- NLTK's VaderSentiment Package for Sentiment Analysis
- Pandas, Numpy, and other packages for data analysis and engineering

AWS Infrastructure

- Elastic Beanstalk for Deployment
- RDS (PostgreSQL)
- Lambda for automation of daily pipeline

### Predictions

**Sentiment Analysis**

Our sentiment analysis model builds on NLTK's VaderSentiment module. To better analyze financial posts, we updated the default model with stock market specific lexicon.

For example, the word "long" is associated with positive sentiment scores in our model, while colloquially it would have little impact on sentiment.
